You will hear a professor of philosophy giving a talk on the influential philosophy of empiricism. First, you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40.&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;hr&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Speaker&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;Philosophy is the basis of how thought can shape life. And, throughout history, it has played an integral role in some of the world&#x27;s most revolutionary moments.&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;Today, I&#x27;d like to focus on one transformative philosophy called empiricism. Now, historically speaking, &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x325B;empiricism is unique because much of it is abstract and based on theory.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E; Early empiricism traces back to Aristotle, who lived during the Classical period in Ancient Greece.&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;Aristotle was the first to introduce the phrase &#x3C;i&#x3E;&#x27;tabula rasa,&#x27;&#x3C;/i&#x3E; which he used to summarise his belief that sensory experiences shape human knowledge. In English, tabula rasa translates to &#x27;blank slate,&#x27; and Aristotle believed that the human mind was exactly that&#x2014;a clean canvas to be coloured by life experiences. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x325C;Surprisingly, this concept only became widely popular after the 1600s even though its roots trace back to Ancient Greece.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;The main principle of empiricism is called the Principle of Acquaintance and it suggests that we can only have knowledge of things or concepts that we&#x27;ve observed first-hand. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x325D;That is to say that we cannot transfer our own knowledge to other people because everyone has different experiences.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;A famous 17th-century empiricist, John Locke, often referred to as the father of British empiricism, wrote that &#x27;No man&#x27;s knowledge &#x2026; can go beyond his experience.&#x27; Specifically, Locke argues that we do not possess any knowledge when we are born because we cannot inherit knowledge, so it&#x27;s up to us to create knowledge through our experiences. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x325E;Locke emphasises that education is only the foundation to being knowledgeable because to an empiricist, &#x27;education begins the gentleman, but reading, good company, and reflection must finish him.&#x27;&#x3C;/mark&#x3E; Using this statement as a guide, we can understand how empiricism has been applied to various fields throughout history, and how it is still practised today.&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;Take education for example. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x325F;Many schools help students learn by sending them on trips to allow them to have new experiences.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E; Teachers accompany the students, and &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x325F;they usually go to places such as science or history museums.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E; Similarly, many schools also give students the opportunity to do hands-on experiments in science class to teach them about scientific concepts, which is another way that learning by experience is used in education.&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;Empiricism is also important in social psychology. A famous exercise called the &#x27;Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes&#x27; exercise was created by Jane Elliott in the 1900s to allow people to learn through experience. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x32B1;The exercise was carried out to give people the opportunity to learn about issues such as discrimination&#x3C;/mark&#x3E; by putting them in unfamiliar situations. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x32B2;This strategy helped many understand what people from other social groups experience daily by putting themselves in other peoples&#x27; positions for a short period of time.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;Empiricism is also prevalent in the business sector. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x32B3;It is known that the executives at Duolingo, an online education platform, value knowledge gained from experience as they created an interview process around this concept.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E; First, all interview candidates at Duolingo are driven to the interview location by designated drivers hired by the company, but they don&#x27;t know that this car ride is the first step of the interview. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x32B4;The executives then gather information on each candidate&#x27;s personality and attitude by asking the driver how the candidate treated them during the ride.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E; They gather information from experience, much as empiricists do.&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;I believe that despite empiricism&#x27;s long history, it is still applicable to many fields today, and studying it would help us understand how experience plays a role in contemporary society. The beauty of empiricism is that it takes time to understand because each experience builds upon the previous one. &#x3C;mark class=&#x22;highlight-green&#x22;&#x3E;&#x32B5;So, empiricism&#x2014;in practice&#x2014;requires time and patience. It is also important for people to be open-minded so that their own experiences don&#x27;t limit them, but instead help enlighten them.&#x3C;/mark&#x3E; The empiricists also believe that the most important experiences are the ones that build up the understanding we have of our surroundings and of ourselves, which is a purpose that many people today still relate to.&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;hr&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Directions&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;span style=&#x22;color:#000000;&#x22;&#x3E;That is the end of Part 4. You now have some time to check your answers.&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;",
